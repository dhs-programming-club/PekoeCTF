Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20
_a_b_c_d_e_f_1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_0_ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ that's_really_unfortunate
to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20
OH_MY_GOSH
LOOK
IT'S_THE_FLAG
YOU_FOUND_IT
CONGLATURASHUNS
pekoe{this_is_not_the_flag_45794a}
Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!

Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
Page 20/20
Sonic the Hedgehog By Masashi Kubota
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left is to capture his essential life data. Then you will be complete.
When you awaken, it will be time! Sonic!
It's finally done!
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board! Come on, Sonic.
Don't you want to try it too?
No thanks.
All right, I'll try it myself!
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!
You should give it a try!
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.
I must be hearing things.
Sonic! Help me!
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic! Shut up, Tails!
Sonic.
Are you all right, Sonic?
I'm fine, but who was that?
Sonic, how have you been?
Oh no, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.
Sonic, we've got to hurry up
and do something!
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you go do something? Sonic, you idiot!
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!
Mister! Mister!
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.
I have some urgent business
That's why I'm here.
Mister, this isn't the time to worry about that. Your rocket's on fire! What? No wonder it's getting
with Sonic.
Page 2/20

so warm in here!
Just hold on!
I'll fix it somehow!
I'm not finished yet!
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board. That's amazing! Mister, up ahead! Look out!
What are you talking about? Let's see. Sonic!
Thank you, Sonic!
Old man! Hey, old man!
Ouch!
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.
What are you talking about, Sonic?
I know I'm a little older now,
but back in my heyday I won the Speed Races on Planet Freedom all the time. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies back then too.
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.
It's the President. He wanted...
He wants us to come to the Presidential Palace right away?
Right, that was it! Please hurry!
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that. Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!
I understand!
I don't think so.
Let's go, Tails!
Bon voyage!
Mr. President, what's the
urgent business?
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, hasn't it, Sonic, Tails. It's Eggman!
Page 3/20

Please accept a small token of my gratitude for coming all this way. That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.
Don't do it, please!
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him! That's a dirty trick, Eggman.
Eggman!
You kidnaped them so you could take over South Island, didn't you?
Do you think really think I would do something that underhanded?
Of course!
Listen, Sonic.
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.
No way.
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Sarah?
Help me, Papa!
Sarah!
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!
I guess I don't have a choice.
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.
Really, Sonic?
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom is made up of two separate dimensions. The outer world, the one you live in, is known as the Land of the Sky.
We already know all that.
Quiet! Just shut up!
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.
Recently,
a man who calls himself the God of Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.
I don't know where he came from,
Page 4/20

but he attacked my city with
a battalion of robots.
They completely conquered us. Now, there is no place down there for me to live.
Black Eggman found the complex where the high voltage electricity is stored.
He jammed the Robot Generator,
causing it to run wild.
According to my calculations,
if the Robot Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,
there will be a giant explosion!
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!
What can we do to stop this, Eggman? Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!
Forget about it.
You're the one that created that stupid contraption in the first place.
Why should I have to clean up after you? Sonic! Please do it! South Island...
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,
but please do this for both of us!
When Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.
But what if this is that one other time? Sonic!
Sonic!
Fine, I'll do it.
Sonic...
Tails, take this with you.
What is it?
It's a navigator.
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,
Page 5/20

as long as you keep it with you.
Thank you, Eggman.
Come on, Tails.
Tails, do you really trust that weird, little gadget that Eggman gave you? Knowing him, he might've put
a bomb in there.
Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.
Guess you're right.
Even more importantly, I hope that the President and Sarah are all right.
No, no, no, I don't like it
when you win every time!
All right, one more time!
That's enough! Give up!
We've played a hundred times!
I'll stop being your hostage.
All right, we'll keep playing.
No, no, no, you won again! Fine!
I quit. I want to go for a drive. Absolutely not!
No, no! I want to go for a drive!
How did this get here?
You rock, Eggman!
I get to drive first!
Don't touch that!
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Sarah!
No, stop that! Sarah!
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!
We're getting some bad turbulence here, so hang on, Sonic!
All right, here we go!
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!
Tails!
Tails, are you all right?
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
that tornado!
So this is the Land of Darkness!
Page 6/20

Eggmanland should be straight ahead!
All right! Let's hurry!
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!
Let's get moving!
What is this place?
Let me check. We just exited the warp zone, so this should be... It says these are ancient ruins. Ancient ruins? These?
I never knew the Land of Darkness had any of this.
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.
Let's go!
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!
Sonic, I bet it's because the Robot Generator is out of control
and causing reactions under the ground! Right! We should hurry!
I'm afraid of lightning!
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?
That's what it says.
That has to be Black Eggman!
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.
I congratulate you on eluding my traps and making it all the way here.
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!
I don't think so!
Hold still!
Ouch!
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!
Page 7/20

Ouch! Ouch!
You...
Where are you little brats hiding? Come out here!
We don't have time to mess
around with this guy!
Which way to Eggmanland?
Let me check...
That way!
It's past that highway!
Good! Let's go, Tails!
Okay, Sonic!
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!
What?
We know you can't keep up right now, so we'll just have to finish
this game later.
No way!
This is bad!
I didn't know that thing could fly! Sonic!
Tails, grab onto me!
We're safe!
Don't think you're safe yet.
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll both drown in the ocean below.
I can't swim!
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!
That worked pretty well.
Yeah, let's go.
Why me?
Crash! Crack! Boom!
Oops!
You fools!
Did you really think I'd fall for a stupid trick like that? Take this! What is this stuff?
Sonic!
Tails!
Now, it's time for this!
Now, I just have to finish you off. There's no way those missiles could've
Page 8/20

gotten rid of Sonic so easily.
I told you!
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman! Sonic!
Oh no!
Darn!
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,
but it you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.
You will never make it to Eggmanland! Try to run away from this!
Sonic, I'll save you!
Knuckles!
Hurry and save Sonic!
Oh no! If my tails are stuck together, I can't fly!
I've got it!
Sonic, grab onto this!
Who are you?
Sonic, you can do it!
Oh no!
I'm out of ammo! You are lucky, aren't you! However...
Not lucky enough!
I owe you one, Knuckles.
Right back at you.
It doesn't matter.
You're running away?
I'm not going to let you go,
Black Eggman!
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon! Grab onto me, Sonic!
Sonic's ruined things again!
He'd better enjoy this feeling now, because once he gets to Eggmanland, he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!
What do you mean, worse than Black Eggman?
You're talking about yourself!
You'd better keep your hands off my Sonic, or I'll never forgive you! Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.
Page 9/20

Yeah, that's one more job that I'm not going to get paid for.
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.
I guess I can just put this on your tab. So will you return to treasure hunting? Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!
What is that thing?
That's Eggmanland!
Incredible!
I hope we see you again, Knuckles! See you.
See you later!
Knuckles!
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!
What are you waiting for? If you don't hurry, that thing's going to explode! Wait up, Knuckles!
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!
This is no time to be blown away. You're right. Come on, let's go!
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead!
Got it!
I'm really starting to get excited about this, Sonic.
Just don't let your guard down or you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles. I'll be fine.
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!
All right! Good luck!
Tails, fly! You have to fly!
Yeah, right!
It's too heavy for me to move!
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!
Sonic!
Page 10/20

I'll have you out of there in no time!
Oh no! Gotcha!
Sonic, are you all right?
Something's moving!
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!
What does all this mean?
What is that?
It's pretty!
Black Eggman's ghost!
It's broken.
Watch where you're putting your hands! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!
Ow! Stop it, Sarah!
Please stop, Sarah!
Sarah!
Why are Sarah and Eggman
here together?
I get it, you're Black Eggman!
It wasn't my fault!
Look at that, now you've made her cry. Black Eggman and the haywire Robot Generator were all part of his scheme. He planned the whole thing to trap you! What does all this mean, Eggman?
I don't believe you fell for my trap and made it all the way here.
Now this will be your burial place! Good job, Sonic!
What did you say?
You're kidding me!
This is the greatest invention of Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!
I call it the Hyper Metal Sonic.
Pretty good, don't you think?
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,
but he's no match for the real Sonic! Tails, it should be apparent to you. Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier. Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.
He is the fastest, most powerful battle machine every to walk Planet Freedom!
Page 11/20

What are you planning on doing
with that thing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,
and then I'm going to destroy the Land of the Sky.
What did you say?
There's no way you'll get away with this!
Let Sarah go, Eggman!
Tell me that after you've defeated him. Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me. I want to take him out on my own!
Man, he's fast! This is the first time I've ever seen Sonic like this! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! That is an invention worthy of being called my greatest creation ever!
He's in trouble! Sonic!
Keep going, Metal Sonic!
Sonic!
Wait, Tails!
Sonic!
Hold up, Tails!
But if we don't hurry then
Calm down, Tails!
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.
We've got to think of another way! What?
That's right.
He did say something about destroying the Land of the Sky, didn't he?
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Sarah?
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer. No, I want to go home now!
If you just wait a few more minutes, I'll show you something
really spectacular.
Where did he go?
Sonic...
Page 12/20

That's it!
Perfect! Perfect!
Sonic has finally been defeated!
Tails!
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you? That's a warp zone right in front of us! We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?
What a nice, peaceful night.
Sonic, you're back already?
Sonic, what's the matter?
Please stop it!
Where am I?
Tails...
I remember leaving Eggmanland. Impossible! I've got to stop Metal!
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?
Oh man!
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.
That old man was watching
the house for us!
Old man! Old man!
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.
Old man, where are you?
Tails, is that you?
Are you back already?
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes! Don't blame me if he gets mad at you! Don't worry about it.
Sonic came back last night.
He forced me to put on these clothes and then he just flew away.
He flew away?
It's Metal!
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.
At the rate he's going, the Land of the Sky won't last more than a few hours. Now I can take my plan
Page 13/20

to the next stage.
Here you go, Sarah.
This is a present for you.
Yahoo! You rock!
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing! Let's hurry up and find Sonic!
Hold on a second.
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.
I think I can use that.
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't in the same place any more?
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.
I don't get it. How come?
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.
His personality, his likes, his dislikes, even all his thoughts.
That's why he knew to come here.
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.
Even if he is a robot,
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.
The same goes for Sonic.
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.
They're twins, huh?
Green Lake City has been flooded! Forest Town is currently on fire!
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.
We'll patch it through to the monitors. Sonic!
Lmpossible!
Page 14/20

Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Shut up already, I'm busy!
Isn't somebody going to pick that up? Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?
Oh no, not that idiot!
What's he doing now?
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now! Shut up! Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.
I see. Is Sonic there?
Is Sarah safe?
What happened to Black Eggman?
Did you stop the generator?
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!
Mr. President!
Look, Eggman, don't I look cute?
Yes, it suits you very well, Sarah.
But why did you give me a wedding dress? What do you mean?
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us. Then we can get married and live the rest of our lives together, Sarah!
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...
Are you crazy?
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?
I won't do it! Never!
So that's what really happened.
But I still don't think it will enough to destroy the Land of the Sky.
It's possible.
I've traveled all over the subterranean levels of this planet,
and I've seen it.
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,
all the continents in the Land of the Sky are linked by a huge glacier.
Page 15/20

Many rivers of magma run beneath the surface of the continents. They're shaped like blood vessels under the glacier.
If the tip of this glacier were ever punctured by an explosion,
the magma would pour directly into the glacier, melting all the ice. What do you think will happen if the continents lose all their support? Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,
they'll be thrown into outer space. This is impossible!
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic a word about any of this!
I know that!
Why am I not supposed to be told about this, Tails?
Sonic, you're safe!
It's too late. I heard all of it. Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.
What did you say?
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!
We must stop him at any cost!
Roger!
Sonic.
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.
He must have gone after Metal.
He went north!
We'll have to do our best too.
We have to stop Metal no matter what! He's headed to the North Pole.
That means Metal has finally found the point of destruction.
Here we go, Sarah!
No, no!
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!
Why me? Hold on tight,
Page 16/20

we're about to hit a warp zone.
No! I told you to stop! Stop!
All right!
Now we have to access Metal's memory banks and adjust them.
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?
After all, it used to be Eggman's. Don't worry about it.
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic. I know what to do!
Oh no, I'm too late.
Where'd he go?
He's got to be around here somewhere! What?
Then this will be the real fight.
We'll fight until only one of us is left standing, all right, Metal?
What? This world isn't big enough for the both of us, you say?
Well, the feeling's mutual.
You might know everything I'm
going to do,
but I know everything you're
going to do too!
It's a strange feeling!
Sonic, you're still alive?
Sonic, what's wrong with you?
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.
This is my chance!
Sarah!
Sonic!
Oh no, my Sarah!
That was close!
Knuckles!
Sonic!
You're a perfect target for me now, fox! Ready, aim...
Fire Eggman missiles!
Page 17/20

Gotcha!
Oh no, another design failure!
That's all right. More importantly, what happened to Sarah?
Oh man, I can't stop!
You saved me! Thank you, Mr. Mole! Somebody stop me please!
I have more power than I thought I did! There you are Sarah.
It's time for you to come with me now. Look out!
Tails!
Sorry!
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.
Look, it's Metal!
Sonic!
Stop it, Metal!
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then that's it for all of us!
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!
Well...
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you? Right!
Here we go!
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!
Sonic!
What do you think you're doing?
Why is this stupid thing that looks like Sonic causing so much trouble?
Oh, that's right!
I hope this works!
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky, then I'll have to marry Eggman!
Take that! And that! And that!
Come on!
Got it!
Now, Sonic!
Sonic!
Good work, Tails! You saved us!
Who is that?
Page 18/20

It doesn't look like Eggman.
That's papa's rocket!
What did you say?
What? Is the door stuck?
We're in trouble! The heat from the lava could cause it to explode! Sarah, you wait here.
Come on, let's go!
Papa!
Of all the pointless stunts...
I know.
If that thing explodes right there, we'll all be in trouble.
Sonic!
Get out of my way, Metal!
Darn!
Sonic!
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get the President out of there!
Eggman!
Trying to overload him by making him assimilate Sonic's personality? Lmpressive, Tails.
But you're too late.
Metal, destroy Sonic!
Hurry! Hurry!
I know! Shut up!
Oh no!
Papa!
Mr. President!
Old man!
Sonic!
Sonic, are you all right?
Metal?
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing? Sonic!
Grab onto my hand!
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!
There is only one Sonic...
Metal!
Don't do it, Sonic!
Metal!
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
Page 19/20

It's not like you at all.
She's right! It was thanks to you that the planet was saved!
Eggman!
You're all fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data! Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal that won't have Sonic's personality. And then I, Eggman, will finally take over the entire planet!
It must be humbling to be in the presence of one so great as Eggman! What are you doing? Stop!
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right! Almost, but not quite.
What did you do that for?
So now we're finally even, Sonic.
What do you mean?
Come back, Knuckles!
Hey, Sonic, wait up!
Why'd you hit me?
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!
I don't remember doing that!
You did!
I don't remember!
Not so fast!
You're not going to get away from me! I'll get your data again, Sonic! What? What?
What are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!
Of course I will! Hang on!
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic! Sonic, I'll get your data again!
I'm getting out of here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!
Hey, wait up, Sonic!
